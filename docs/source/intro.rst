You can also build the latest version `from Github here <https://www.github.com/krummja/pygame_orion>`_ by downloading the source, navigating to the project's directory (which contains ``setup.py``) and building with:

.. code-block:: console

    python setup.py install
    pip install . -U

The source code is `available from Github here <https://www.github.com/krummja/pygame_orion>`_.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

Using Orion assumes some basic familiarity with Pygame. Additionally, it will be useful to be acquainted with Pygame GUI and, at the very least, what an ECS is. There are many helpful tutorials and guides across the internet, but I recommend checking out the following as a baseline:

- `Pygame <https://www.pygame.org/docs/>`_
- `Pygame GUI <https://pygame-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
